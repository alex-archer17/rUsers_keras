These slides along with the Rmarkdown file provide an introduction to using Keras for Deep Learning in the R programming language. The tutorial begins with a brief introduction to Deep Learning and then provides an example of how to build a neural network for product recommendations. A few sample datasets are provided so users may try out this technique on their own.
